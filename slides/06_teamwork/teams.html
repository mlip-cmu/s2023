* "D. failed to catch the latest 2 meetings. Along the commit history, he merely committed 4 and the 3 earliest commits are some setups. And the latest one commits is to add his name on the meeting log, for which we almost finished when he joined."
* "Unprepared with his deliverables, very unresponsive on WhatsApp recently, and just overall being a bad team player."
* "Consistently failed to meet deadlines. Communication improved over the course of the milestone but needed repeated prompts to get things done. Did not ask for help despite multiple offers."

No visible progress until last minute

Late work

Incomplete or low quality solutions at integration

Unresponsive team members

Passive, uninterested team members without initiative

**Sources?**

* Priority differences ("10-601 is killing me, I need to work on that first", "I have dance class tonight")

* Working style differences (deadline driven vs planner)

1. One team member has very little technical experience and is struggling with basic Python scripts and the Unix shell. It is faster for other team members to take over the task rather than helping them.
2. You divide the work and but when you try to integrate on the evening before the deadline you learn that one team member has failed to complete their part. They tried the day before, but got stuck with a dependency problem.
3. After last minute stress at the last assignment, you team agrees to start earlier and to integrate at a milestone days before the deadline to leave a buffer. Yet you see little progress from half the team in GitHub and hardly anybody responds in Slack. Little is done at the agreed milestone.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Breakout: Navigating Team Issues

Pick one or two of the scenarios (or another one team member faced in the past) and openly discuss proactive/reactive solutions

As a team, tagging team members, post to `#lecture`:

> 1. Brief problem description 
> 2. How to prevent in the first place
> 3. What to do when it occurs anyway

</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Teamwork Policy in this Course

Teams can set their own priorities and policies – do what works for you, experiment
   * Not everybody will contribute equally to every assignment – that's okay
   * Team members have different strength and weaknesses – that's good

We will intervene in *team citizenship* issues!

> Golden rule: Try to do what you agreed to do by the time you agreed to. If you cannot, seek help and communicate clearly and early.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Team Citizenship

<div class="smallish">


* Be responsive and responsible
* Come to meetings on time, participate actively
* Stick to commitments, work on assigned tasks
* When problems, reach out, replan, communicate early, be proactive
* (Replanning and dealing with mistakes is normal)

We will adjust grades if complains about:
* Lack of communication
* Disrespectful or dismissive communication
* Not attending team meetings (without excuse)
* Blowing internal deadlines without communication
* Failing to complete agreed tasks without timely communication

</div></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Peer Grading Process and Support

We are here to help! Teamwork is a learning goal

TA assigned as mentor to every team, reach out for support

Team citizenship survey after every milestone

Debriefing with TA after every milestone, discuss how it went and how to improve

Adjusting grades based on survey and communication with course staff
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Peer Grading Mechanics

<div class="small">


* Survey with rating form and text field, explaining what the issue is
* We discard complains without explanation and those beyond team citizenship (e.g, regarding ability or effort)
* Will immediately adjust grade, forcing the issue in the team
    * See [form](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/F2022/assignments/peergrading.html) to preview effects
    * Can lead to substantial grade adjustments (-10% to -50% common)
    * Instructors listen to appeals
* *If entire team agrees, this can be used to adjust grades for intentionally imbalanced contributions*
* Depending on severity, TAs will escalate to instructors

![Peer rating preview form](adj.png)

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Avoiding Adversarial Peer Grading

* Peer grading focuses only on team citizenship
* Comments are required for negative ratings and read by TAs and instructors
*
* *Avoid avoiding conflict:* Set high standards and give honest feedback *before* mounting frustration and spiraling problems


</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Tips for Getting Started
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Establish Communication and Meeting Patterns

<div class="smallish">

* Agree on how to communicate in the team: Email? Slack? Whatsapp?
* Agree on communication expectation. Different people have different habits and expectations. Be explicit!
    * Read emails daily? On weekends?
    * Respond to urgent chat messages within 3h? Read old chat messages?
    * Be available for chat during certain hours?
+ Find meeting times. Plan ahead or meeting as needed?
+ Set **intermediate internal deadline** for integration
+ Set realistic expectations:  All have other classes and distractions; communicate availability openly
+ **Write down expectations!**

</div>

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Some Communication Tips

<div class="smallish">

* Focus full-group meetings on planning and reflection, meet in smaller groups for focused work
* Use Slack/chat deliberately
    - consider chat ephemeral, don't expect everybody to catch up on all old messages
    - separate social communication from work comm., urgent from not urgent
    - explicitly tag people if you need their input, enable notifications during "working hours"
    - discuss non-urgent, long-term things outside of chat associated with topic (issue tracker, Google doc, ...)
* Reserve time for socializing and celebrating success (bonus points!)

</div>

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Share the Work

* Team members have different strength and weaknesses – that's good
* Make use of individual strength of team members (split, pair up, help, ...)
* Usually somebody will take responsibility for team management tasks (e.g., schedule meetings, moderate, meeting notes, track work, reminders, check submission) or reporting
  * Team management is work too
  * Consider rotating

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Maintain Accountability

<div class="smallish">
 
* **Write down explicit deliverables: *Who* does *what* by *when***
    - Be explicit about expected results, should be verifiable 
    - Track completion, check off when done
    - GitHub issues, Jira, Trello board, Miro, Google docs, Slack, ... – **single source of truth, with history tracking** (see next recitation)
* Complete deliverable list **during meeting**: everybody writes their own deliverables, others read all deliverables to check understanding
    - if not completed during meeting or team member not at meeting, email assignment after meeting to everybody; no objection within 24h counts as agreement with task assignment
* We will ask for evidence of this with the first milestone
* Consider sharing with teams' TA mentor

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Recall: Common Sources of Conflict

<div class="smallish">

* Different team members have different working patterns and communication preferences
    - e.g., start early vs close to deadline; plan ahead vs try and error
    - e.g., react to every notification vs reduce distractions, read email once a day
    - **discuss and set explicit expectations; talk about conflicts**
* Different abilities, unexpected difficulties
    - work in pairs, plan time for rework and integration
    - replan, contribute to teams in different ways
    - **work around it, it's the team's responsibility**
* Unreliable team members, poor team citizenship
    - e.g., not starting the work in agreed time, not responding, not attending
    - have written clear deliverables with deadlines
    - **talk about it within team, talk to course staff, peer grading**

</div>

* Teamwork is unavoidable, teams rarely fully self-selected, good teams are fun
* Teamwork is hard, skills to be learned
* Many well known teamwork issues, including groupthink and social loafing
