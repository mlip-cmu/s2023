How to train models that are fair w.r.t. anti-classification?

--> Simply remove features for protected attributes from training and inference data

--> Null/randomize protected attribute during inference

*(does not account for correlated attributes, is not required to)*
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Testing Anti-Classification

How do we test that a classifier achieves anti-classification?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Testing Anti-Classification

Straightforward invariant for classifier $f$ and protected attribute $p$: 

$\forall x. f(x[p\leftarrow 0]) = f(x[p\leftarrow 1])$

*(does not account for correlated attributes, is not required to)*

Test with *any* test data, e.g., purely random data or existing test data

Any single inconsistency shows that the protected attribute was used. Can also report percentage of inconsistencies.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Anti-Classification Discussion

*Testing of anti-classification barely needed, because easy to ensure by constructing during training or inference!*

Anti-classification is a good starting point to think about protected attributes

Useful baseline for comparison

Easy to implement, but only effective if (1) no proxies among features
and (2) protected attributes add no predictive power 
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Group fairness

* Anti-classification (fairness through blindness)
* __Group fairness (independence)__
* Equalized odds (separation)
* ...and numerous others and variations!
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group fairness

Key idea: Compare outcomes across two groups
* Similar rates of accepted loans across racial/gender groups?
* Similar chance of being hired/promoted between gender groups?
* Similar rates of (predicted) recidivism across racial groups?

Outcomes matter, not accuracy!
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Disparate impact vs. disparate treatment

Disparate treatment: Practices or rules that treat a certain protected
group(s) differently from others
* e.g., Apply different mortgage rules for people from different backgrounds 

Disparate impact: Neutral rules, but outcome is worse for
 one or more protected groups
* Same rules are applied, but certain groups have a harder time
  obtaining mortgage in a particular neighborhood 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group fairness in discrimination law

Relates to *disparate impact* and the four-fifth rule

Can sue organizations for discrimination if they 
* mostly reject job applications from one minority group (identified by protected classes) and hire mostly from another
* reject most loans from one minority group and more frequently accept applicants from another

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Notations

* $X$: Feature set (e.g., age, race, education, region, income, etc.,)  
* $A \in X$: Sensitive attribute (e.g., gender)
* $R$: Regression score (e.g., predicted likelihood of on-time loan payment)
* $Y'$: Classifier output
  * $Y' = 1$ if and only if $R > T$ for some threshold $T$
  * e.g., Grant the loan ($Y' = 1$) if the likelihood of paying back > 80% 
* $Y$: Target variable being predicted ($Y = 1$ if the person actually
  pays back on time)

[Setting classification thresholds: Loan lending example](https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml)


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group Fairness

$P[Y' = 1 | A = a]  = P[Y' = 1 | A = b]$

* Also called _independence_ or _demographic parity_
* Mathematically, $Y' \perp A$
  * Prediction ($Y'$)  must be independent of the sensitive attribute ($A$)
* Examples:
	* The predicted rate of recidivism is the same across all races
	* Both women and men have the equal probability of being promoted
		* i.e., P[promote = 1 | gender = M] = P[promote = 1 | gender = F] 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group Fairness Limitations

What are limitations of group fairness?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Group Fairness Limitations

* Ignores possible correlation between $Y$ and $A$
  * Rules out perfect predictor $Y' = Y$ when $Y$ & $A$ are correlated!
* Permits abuse and laziness: Can be satisfied by randomly assigning    a positive outcome ($Y' = 1$) to protected groups
	* e.g., Randomly promote people (regardless of their
      job performance) to match the rate across all groups
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Adjusting Thresholds for Group Fairness

Select different classification thresholds ($t_0$, $t_1$) for different groups (A = 0,  A = 1) to achieve group fairness, such that 
$P[R > t_0 | A = 0]  = P[R > t_1 | A = 1]$

<div class="smallish">

Example: Mortgage application
  * R: Likelihood of paying back the loan on time
  * Suppose: With a uniform threshold used (i.e., R = 80%), group fairness is not achieved
	* P[R > 0.8 | A = 0] = 0.4,  P[R > 0.8 | A = 1] = 0.7
  * Adjust thresholds to achieve group fairness
	* P[R > 0.6 | A = 0]  = P[R > 0.8 | A = 1]
* Wouldn't group A = 1 argue it's unfair? When does this type of adjustment make sense?

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Testing Group Fairness

*How would you test whether a classifier achieves group fairness?*

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Testing Group Fairness

Collect realistic, representative data (not randomly generated!)
* Use existing validation/test data
* Monitor production data
* (Somehow) generate realistic test data, e.g. from probability distribution of population

Separately measure the rate of positive predictions
* e.g., P[promoted = 1 | gender = M],      P[promoted = 1 | gender = F] = ?

Report issue if the rates differ beyond some threshold $\epsilon$ across
groups
  
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Equalized odds

* Anti-classification (fairness through blindness)
* Group fairness (independence)
* **Equalized odds (separation)**
* ...and numerous others and variations!
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Equalized odds

Key idea: Focus on accuracy (not outcomes) across two groups

* Similar default rates on accepted loans across racial/gender groups?
* Similar rate of "bad hires" and "missed stars" between gender groups?
* Similar accuracy of predicted recidivism vs actual recidivism across racial groups?

Accuracy matters, not outcomes!
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Equalized odds in discrimination law

Relates to *disparate treatment*

Typically, lawsuits claim that protected attributes (e.g., race, gender) were used in decisions even though they were irrelevant
* e.g., fired over complaint because of being Latino, whereas other White employees were not fired with similar complaints

Must prove that the defendant had *intention* to discriminate
* Often difficult: Relying on shifting justifications, inconsistent application of rules, or explicit remarks overheard or documented
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Equalized odds

$P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=a] = P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=b]$
$P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=a] = P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=b]$

Statistical property of *separation*: $Y' \perp A | Y$
  * Prediction must be independent of the sensitive attribute
  _conditional_ on the target variable
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Review: Confusion Matrix

![](confusion-matrix.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

Can we explain separation in terms of model errors?
* $P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=a] = P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=b]$
* $P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=a] = P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=b]$
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Separation

$P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=a] = P[Y'=1∣Y=0,A=b]$ (FPR parity)

$P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=a] = P[Y'=0∣Y=1,A=b]$ (FNR parity)

* $Y' \perp A | Y$: Prediction must be independent of the sensitive attribute
    _conditional_ on the target variable
* i.e., All groups are susceptible to the same false positive/negative rates
* Example: Y': Promotion decision, A: Gender of applicant: Y: Actual job performance
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Testing Separation

Requires realistic representative test data (telemetry or representative test data, not random)

Separately measure false positive and false negative rates
  * e..g, for FNR, compare P[promoted = 0 | female, good employee] vs P[promoted = 0 | male, good employee]


*How is this different from testing group fairness?*

<!-- </script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Practitioner Challenges

* Fairness is a system-level property
  - Consider goals, user interaction design, data collection, monitoring, model interaction (properties of a single model may not matter much)
* Fairness-aware data collection, fairness testing for training data
* Identifying blind spots
  - Proactive vs reactive
  - Team bias and (domain-specific) checklists
* Fairness auditing processes and tools
* Diagnosis and debugging (outlier or systemic problem? causes?)
* Guiding interventions (adjust goals? more data? side effects? chasing mistakes? redesign?)
* Assessing human bias of humans in the loop
