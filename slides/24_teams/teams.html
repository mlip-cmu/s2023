Yet, the large team appears to produce about the same mount of output in only an average of 12 days’ less time. This is a truly astonishing finding, through it fits with my personal experience on projects over 35 years. - [Phillip Amour, 2006, CACM 49:9](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1151043)

* Avoid overhead
* Ensure reliability
* Constraint latency
* 
* e.g. Issue tracker vs email; online vs face to face

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Establishing Interfaces

* When dividing work, need to agree on interface
* Common source of mismatch and friction
* **Examples?**
    - Team A uses data produced by Team B
    - Team C deploys model produced by team A
    - Team D uses model and needs to provide feedback to Team A
    - Team D waits for improvement/feature from model A
*
* Ideally interfaces are stable and well documented

<div class="small">

> As the functional departments grew, staffing the heavily matrixed projects became more and more of a nightmare. To address this, the company reorganized itself into “Studios”, each with dedicated resources for each of the major functional areas reporting up to a Studio manager. Given direct responsibility for performance and compensation, Studio managers could allocate resources freely.

> The Studios were able to exert more direct control on the projects and team members, but not without a cost. The major problem that emerged from Brøderbund’s Studio reorganization was that members of the various functional disciplines began to lose touch with their functional counterparts. Experience wasn’t shared as easily. Over time, duplicate effort began to appear.

* Mutual benefits (faster releases, more telemetry, improved reliability, fewer conflicts)
* T-shaped professionals
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Changing practices and culture is hard

* Ingrained "us vs them" and blame culture
* Inertia is hard to overcome (“this is how we always did things”)
* Learning cost for new concepts and tools
* Extra effort for new practices (e.g., testing)
* Overwhelmed with current tasks, no time to learn/change
* Poor adoption may cause more costs than benefits
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Working on Culture Change

* Bottom-up and top-down change possible
* Often introduced by individual advocates, convincing others
* Always requires supportive management
* Education helps generate buy-in
* Consultants can help with adoption and learning
* 
* Demonstrate benefits in one small project, promote from there
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Beyond DevOps

* Organizational culture and DevOps have been well studied
* Learn from joint goal setting, joint vocabulary, win-win-collaborations, joint tooling
*
* *What could this look like for other groups (MLOps, MLDev, SecDevOps, LawML, DataExp, SafeML, UIDev, ...)?*
