<div class="smallish">


**Infrastructure:** Understand chat bot infrastructure and its capabilities

**Knowing topics:** Identify what users talk about, train/test concepts with past chat logs
  * "*We fed VocabX a line deliberately trying to confuse it. We wrote, ‘I am thinking about chapter 13 in Boston divorce filing.’ VocabX figured out the two topics: (1) business and industrial/company/bankruptcy (2) society/social institution/divorce.*"

**Guiding conversations:** Supporting open-ended conversations requires detecting what's on topic and finding a good response; intent-topic modeling
  * *Is talk about parents and children on topic when discussing divorce?*
  * Data gathering/labeling very challenging -- too many corner cases

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Stepping Back: What are the goals of the system?

<!-- discussion -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Status meeting with (inhouse) Customer

<div class="small">

The chatbot performed better than before but was far from ready for deployment. There were “too many edge cases” in which conversations did not go as planned. 

> **Customer:** "Maybe we need to think about it like an 80/20 rule. In some cases, it works well, but for some, it is harder. 80% everything is fine, and in the remaining 20%, we try to do our best."
>
> **Data science lead:** The trouble is how to automatically recognize what is 80 and what is 20.
>
> **Data scientist:** It is harder than it sounds. One of the models is a matching model trained on pairs of legal questions and answers. 60,000 of them. It seems large but is small for ML.
>
> **Customer:** That’s a lot. Can it answer a question about say visa renewal?
>
> **Data scientist:** If there exists a question like that in training data, then yes. But with just 60,000, the model can easily overfit, and then for anything outside, it would just fail.
>
> **Customer:** I see what you are saying. Edge cases are interesting from an academic perspective, but for a business the first and foremost thing is value. You are trying to solve an interesting problem. I get it. But I feel that you may have already solved it enough to gain business value.

* Collect user data to sell to lawyers
* Signal technical competency to lawyers
* Acceptable to fail: Too complicated for self-help, connect with lawyer
* Solving edge cases not important

> "Edge cases are important, but the end goal is user information, monetizing user data. We are building a legal self-help chatbot, but a major business use case is to tell people: ‘here, talk to this lawyer.’ We do want to connect them with a lawyer. Even for 20%, when our bot fails, we tell users that the problem cannot be done through self-help. Let us get you a lawyer, right? That is what we wanted in the first place."

<div class="smallish">

*Innate/overall goals of the organization*

* Business
    * Current/future revenue, profit
    * Reduce business risks
* Non-Profits
    - Lives saved, animal welfare increased, CO2 reduced, fires averted
    - Social justice improved, well-being elevated, fairness improved
* Often not directly measurable from system output; slow indicators

**Implication: Accurate ML models themselves are not the ultimate goal!**

**ML may only indirectly influence such organizational
  objectives; influence is often hard to quantify; lagging measures**

</div>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Leading Indicators

<div class="smallish">

*Short-term proxies for long-term measures*

Typically measures correlating with future success, from the business perspective




Examples: 
* Customers sentiment: Do they like the product? (e.g., surveys, ratings)
* Customer engagement: How often do they use the product?
  * Regular use, time spent on site, messages posted
  * Growing user numbers, recommendations

Caveats
  * Often indirect, proxy measures
  * Can be misleading (e.g., more daily active users => higher profits?)

*Concrete outputs the system (or a feature of the system) should produce*

Relates to system requirements

* Provide and recommend music to stream
* Make personalized music recommendations
* Transcribe audio files
* Provide legal help with a self-service chatbot



</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## User Goals

*How well the system is serving its users, from the user's perspective*

Examples: 
  * Users choosing recommended items and enjoying them
  * Users making better decisions

  * Users achieving their goals

Easier and more granular to measure, but possibly only indirect relation to organization/system objectives

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Model Goals

<div class="smallish">

In enterprise ML teams:
* Data scientists often focus on modeling in local environment, model-centric workflow
* Rarely robust infrastructure, often monolithic and tangled
* Challenges in deploying systems and integration with monitoring, streams etc

Shifting to pipeline-centric workflow challenging
* Requires writing robust programs, slower, less exploratory
* Standardized, modular infrastructure 
* Big conceptual leap, major hurdle to adoption

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Summary

Production AI-enabled systems require a *whole system perspective*, beyond just the model or the pipeline

Distinguish goals: organization, system, user, model goals

Quality at a *system* level: safety beyond the model, beyond accuracy

Large design space for user interface (intelligent experience): forcefulness, frequency, telemetry

Plan for operations (telemetry, updates)
