# Midterm

This semester, the course will have a midterm, but no final exam. 

The midterm will take the place of one lecture, it is 80 minutes. No electronics, but 6 pages of notes (handwritten or printed, both sides, letter size) allowed.

Topic-wise, everything covered in class, in the readings, and in recitation is fair game, though the exam will focus most points on topics where you had some chance to practice (e.g., in assignments, recitation or in-class discussions) not on random recall questions.

## Practice Material

Midterms from previous semesters are available as practice. We expect the midterm to have a similar format, though topic coverage differs slightly between semesters.
